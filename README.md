# CMPM 121 D1 Project

First UI change that I made was making the buttons aligned vertically on the right side which was inspired by <https://github.com/fractalizes/cmpm-121-f25-d1>

Second UI change was inspired by <https://github.com/UriosteguiM12/cmpm-121-f25-d1> in which they implemented random falling pizzas on the side but for my game I thought it more fitting to have a tomato thrown every time you click the tomato in the center.
